Write a function which:\
**1)** inserts a node;\
**2)** finds a node;\
**3)** deletes a node;\
**4)** finds the node with smallest value;\
**5)** finds the node with biggest value;\
**6)** finds the smallest value in the tree;\
**7)** finds the biggest value in the tree;\
**8)** prints the values from the tree in ascending order;\
**9)** prints the values from the tree in descending order;\
**10)** prints the values from the tree in following order: right, left, root;\
**11)** prints the values from the tree with bfs (Breadth First Search);\
**12)** counts the number of nodes on each level and prints them in the following format: *&lt;numberNodesLevel0>;&lt;numberNodesLevel1>;…;&lt;numberNodesLevel n>*\
**13)** checks if the tree is binary search tree (with dfs - Depth First Search );\
**14)** checks if the tree is binary search tree (with intervals );\
**15)** finds the height of the tree;\
**16)** realizes a vertival order traversal;\
**17)** finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (lca) in the binary tree of 2 given nodes;\
**18)** checks if the tree is symmetric;\
**19)** prints the values from the tree in preorder (root,left,right) in the following format: *&lt;ValueFirstNode>;&lt;ValueSecondNode>;…;&lt;ValueLastNode>*\
**20)** realizes top view – with and without a struct;\
**21)** finds the K-th biggest value in the binary search tree (1 is the biggest value);\
**22)** finds the upper bound of given value (finds the node with given value if exists or the node with smallest value, which is bigger than the given one (if such node exists) );\
**23)** finds the lower bound of given value (finds the node with given value if exists or the node with biggest value, which is smaller than the given one (if such node exists) );\
**24)** creates a binary search tree from sorted array.
